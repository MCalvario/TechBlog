# TechBlog

## Description
As a full-stack web developer who writes about tech, I want to create a CMS-style blog site that other web developers, including myself, can publish articles, blog posts, and thoughts/opinions.

# Usage

To use my CMS-style blog site, When you visit the site for the first time, you will be presented with the homepage, which includes existing blog posts (if any have been posted); navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard; and the option to log in. When you click on the homepage option, you will be taken to the homepage. When you click on any other links in the navigation, you will be prompted to either sign up or sign in. When you choose to sign up, you will be prompted to create a username and password. When you click on the sign-up button, your user credentials are saved and you will be logged into the site. When you revisit the site at a later time and choose to sign in, you will be prompted to enter your username and password. When you are signed in to the site, you will see navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard, and the option to log out. When you click on the homepage option in the navigation, you will be taken to the homepage and presented with existing blog posts that include the post title and the date created. When you click on an existing blog post, you will be presented with the post title, contents, post creator’s  username, and date created for that post and have the option to leave a comment. When you enter a comment and click on the submit button while signed in, the comment is saved and the post is updated to display the comment, the comment creator’s username, and the date created. When you click on the dashboard option in the navigation, you will be taken to the dashboard and presented with any blog posts you have already created and the option to add a new blog post. When you click on the button to add a new blog post, you will be prompted to enter both a title and contents for your blog post. When you click on the button to create a new blog post, the title and contents of your post are saved and you are taken back to an updated dashboard with your new blog post. 
When you click on one of your existing posts in the dashboard, you are able to delete or update your post and taken back to an updated dashboard. When you click on the logout option in the navigation, you are signed out of the site. When you are idle on the site for more than a set time, you are able to view posts and comments but are prompted to log in again before you can add, update, or delete posts.
